		<h1>Timeout test</h1>
		
		<p>
		This test page tests the timeout functionality of dojo.io.script, and to make
		sure that requests that time out get removed quickly. If the server response
		is received after the script has been timed out, there should not be weird 
		errors as the browser tries to evaluate the responses after the desired time
		period.
		</p>
		
		<p>This test requires a server running PHP to work.</p>
		
		<p>
		<p><strong>Firefox Oddity:</strong> Firefox
		will print an error after the script response is received from the server:<br />
		<span style="color: red">dojo.io.script.jsonp_dojoIoScript1 has no properties</span>
		This is bad because Firefox goes ahead and evaluates the script contents in the page's
		JavaScript space (this happens even when I turn off Firefox Add-Ons). All other browsers
		do not evaluate the script (given the weird Opera 9.22 behavior below). You can test this
		by clicking the <b>Test for SuperXFooBarVariable</b> button after receiving the response
		for timeout.php (check Firebug Net tab to see when request is received). All other browsers
		show an error or show the "undefined" value for SuperXFooBarVariable, but Firefox will show its
		value as being: "Oh no! SuperXFooBarVariable is defined (should not be for timeout case)".
		
		<p><strong>Opera Oddity:</strong> Opera 9.22 does not seem to trigger the timeout case,
		but rather it waits for the server to send a response to the script before continuing past the
		point where the script is added to the DOM? That seems wrong. Dynamic script tags are no longer
		an async operation?
